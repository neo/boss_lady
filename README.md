# Boss Lady

Make it easier to manage your factory girls.

## Target audience and goals

* Developers
  To make it easier to find which factory and trait combination that you want.
  To encourage creation of reusable traits.
* BA's and Product Owners
  To allow a non-developer to create the test data that is required.

## How we're intending to do this

Give a listing of all the available models
Allow the user to select a model which will result in listing their traits.
Allow the user to select the required traits which will be created.

## Testing
Symlink to factories_controller_spec is created so that we can test it from dummy app
